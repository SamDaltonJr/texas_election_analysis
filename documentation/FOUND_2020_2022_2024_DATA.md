## 🔍 Two Plans: PLANH2316 vs. PLANH2176

### Why Two Plans?

Texas redrew its House district boundaries after the 2020 Census:

- **PLANH2316** (2021): Original redistricting plan enacted by the Legislature
- **PLANH2176** (2021): Court-ordered plan after legal challenges

### Which Plan to Use?

**For Elections:**
- **2018**: Only PLANH2316 available (used pre-2020 Census boundaries)
- **2020**: Both plans have this data (2020 election used old boundaries, but results shown in both new plans for comparison)
- **2022, 2024**: Both plans - **PLANH2176 was actually used for these elections**

**Recommendation:**
- Use **PLANH2316** for 2018, 2020 (for consistency with your parsed 2018 data)
- Use **PLANH2176** for 2022, 2024 (this is the official plan used)
- Or use both and note the plan differences in your analysis

### Districtboundary Differences

The district boundaries changed slightly between plans. Some districts were renumbered or reshaped. The PLANH2176 plan was designed to better comply with the Voting Rights Act.

## 🛠️ Next Steps: Parse the Data!

You can now run your parser script on these new PDFs!

### Option 1: Use Your Existing Parser

The `parse_house_district_results_v2.py` script should work with these PDFs since they're the same format as 2018.

```bash
# Extract the PDFs
python extract_pdf_election_data.py

# Then parse each one
python parse_house_district_results_v2.py
```

**Note:** You'll need to modify the scripts to:
1. Loop through all the PDF files
2. Identify which races are in each year (different candidates)
3. Handle the different column structures (2020 has Presidential + Senate, 2022 has Governor + Lt. Gov, etc.)

### Option 2: Extract and Review First

Since each year has different races/candidates, you may want to:

1. **Extract one PDF at a time:**
   ```python
   import pdfplumber
   pdf = pdfplumber.open('2020_planh2316.pdf')
   # Extract and review structure
   ```

2. **Identify the races and candidates** for each year

3. **Update the parser** with the correct race definitions

### Expected Data Structure

After parsing all years, you'll have:

**2018-2024 Combined:**
- ~8,000-10,000 records
- All statewide races by House district
- 5 election cycles
- Multiple races per election

**Columns:**
```csv
year, district, office, candidate, party, votes, percentage
```

## 📈 What You Can Do With This Data

### Analysis Possibilities:

1. **District Trends Over Time**
   - How has each district voted 2018-2024?
   - Which districts are swinging?
   - Identify competitive vs. safe districts

2. **Statewide vs. Local Performance**
   - Do statewide candidates over/underperform in certain districts?
   - Geographic voting patterns
   - Urban vs. rural differences

3. **Presidential vs. Down-Ballot**
   - Presidential coattails effect
   - Ticket-splitting analysis
   - Governor vs. President performance

4. **Demographic Correlations**
   - Cross-reference with SSVR-T (Spanish Surname Voter Registration %)
   - Turnout patterns by district demographics
   - Combine with Census data

5. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Model 2026 Governor race by district
   - Predict 2028 Presidential results
   - Identify persuadable districts
