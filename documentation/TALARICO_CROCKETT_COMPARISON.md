We don't have complete statewide-by-congressional-district data to calculate Crockett's overperformance vs top-of-ticket in TX-30. However:
- TX-30 is known to be very Democratic
- Biden likely won 70-75% in 2020
- Harris likely won 70%+ in 2024
- Crockett's 74.7% (2022) and 84.9% (2024) suggest she matches or slightly exceeds party baseline

## Career Trajectories

### Talarico's Path

**2018**: First elected to HD-52 (not in our dataset)
**2020**: Re-elected HD-52, 51.4% in competitive race
**2021**: Redistricted to HD-50 (much safer)
**2022**: Won HD-50 easily, 76.9%
**2024**: Ran unopposed in HD-50

**Trajectory:** Started in competitive district, moved to safe district. This is **unusual** - most ambitious politicians want to prove themselves in tough races. Suggests either:
- Redistricting forced the move (likely)
- Prefers safe seat over competitive challenges
- Building resume for future run (safe seat = focus on policy/profile)

### Crockett's Path

**2020**: Elected to State House HD-100 (not in our dataset)
**2022**: Ran for U.S. House TX-30, won 74.7%
**2024**: Re-elected TX-30, won 84.9%

**Trajectory:** Rapid rise from State House to U.S. House in 2 years. This shows:
- Ambition and willingness to jump levels
- Strong Democratic support/establishment backing
- National profile building (member of Congress has more visibility)

## Recruitment Assessment

### For 2026 Statewide Race (If Texas Democrats Had to Choose)

**If Running for U.S. Senate vs. Ted Cruz:**

**Better Choice: TALARICO**

Reasons:
- Proven crossover appeal (+4.7 in R district)
- Can point to winning hostile territory
- Can credibly say "I win Republicans"
- Cruz runs behind Trump - Talarico could exploit this

Risk:
- Hasn't been tested recently
- HD-50 is very liberal, may be easy to paint as Austin progressive

**If Running for Governor:**

**Better Choice: TALARICO** (same reasoning)

### For Future (2028+) Statewide Race

**Better Choice: CROCKETT** (if she builds a record)

Reasons:
- More time to build statewide profile
- U.S. House experience shows she can handle big stage
- By 2028, would have 6 years in Congress
- National fundraising network established

Risk:
- Still wouldn't have competitive race experience
- Would need to find way to demonstrate crossover appeal

---

## Bottom Line

**James Talarico** is the **better statewide candidate TODAY** because:
1. He has **proven crossover appeal** (won R+4.3 in 2020)
2. He beat the top-of-ticket by 4.7 points in a **competitive race**
3. He can credibly claim to win Republican voters
4. This is exactly what Democrats need in Texas statewide races

**Jasmine Crockett** is a **strong future prospect** because:
1. She has **national profile and fundraising**
2. She's building a congressional record
3. She's media-savvy and effective communicator
4. But: she needs to demonstrate crossover appeal somehow

**The Data Verdict:**
- Talarico: **Battle-tested** in hostile territory ✓
- Crockett: **Untested** in competitive environment ✗

For a statewide race in red/purple Texas, you want someone who has **proven they can win persuadable Republicans**. That's Talarico (2020). Crockett hasn't had that opportunity yet.

## Recommendations

### For Democrats' 2026 Senate Race:

**If recruiting today:** James Talarico
- Lead with his 2020 win in R+4.3 district
- Message: "I win in Trump country"
- Contrast with Cruz's declining vs-Trump performance

### For Democrats' Long-Term Bench:

**Both should be cultivated:**
- **Talarico**: Run for statewide office soon (2026 or 2028)
- **Crockett**: Continue building House record, run statewide 2028+

### What Each Needs:

**Talarico needs:**
- To run for something competitive again soon
- Can't coast in HD-50 forever
- Needs to prove 2020 wasn't a one-time thing

**Crockett needs:**
- Some way to demonstrate crossover appeal
- Maybe: Focus on bipartisan bills in Congress
- Maybe: Campaign in swing districts for other Democrats
- Build record showing she can win persuadable voters
